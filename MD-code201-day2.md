# MD Code 201 - Day 2
I think today went pretty well. I managed to complete the project with five questions, some yes/no, some asking for specific strings, and it looks like they all worked. I also managed to use css to make the page look passable. I'm no designer, but I'm happy with the way it turned out. My biggest concern right now is how I will deal with projects where the format/solutions are not already given to us in the example. Both today and yesterday I essentially just reproduced the JavaScript that Aaron gave us to explain the project, adjusting as needed to customize it. I suspect when I don't already have the basic solutions I will struggle somewhat. I am also a bit apprehensive about how I will do when we move beyond the material covered in the 102 class. So far it has been mostly review. I hope I will be able to keep up when we enter new territory.
