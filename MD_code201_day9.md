# MD Code 201 - Day 9
Today was much harder than I expected. Not because of the CSS stuff, because I didn't even really get to it. I spent all my time trying to figure out how to get the total for each hour of cookies sold. It sucked, and I still haven't figured it out. I mostly stared at the screen, then got help, then stared, then got help, then went home cause I couldn't handle it anymore.

Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
