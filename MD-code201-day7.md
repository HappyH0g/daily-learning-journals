# MD Code 201 - Day 7
The lecture part of class was pretty confusing by the end, and I wasn't sure if I understood how to do any of the example he wrote up. I was surprised to discover that I got through the first part of the lab today without too much trouble. The example was thorough and I was able to use it to construct my object, add my methods and get things working for the first half. But by the second half I was bogged down again with a bunch of issues that I'm still unclear about. I'm going to spend another hour working on it tonight and see if I can get everything functional. I'm pretty sure I will be spending the weekend finishing up each day's work, because I've yet to complete day 5 or day 6 fully.
