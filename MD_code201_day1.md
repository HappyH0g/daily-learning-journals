"#MD Code 201 - Day 2"
I learned that my computer does not always cooperate, for example, my atom won't open from git Bash. Gotta work around the problems to get to where I want to go. I also learned that I know a little more about git than I realized. Not a lot, but I'm finally starting to be able to figure out what is wrong and how to fix it. The coding today was easy in that they provided a format, so I did not have to come up with any solutions myself. However, it was tedious to write out the responses, especially once they got longer. I guess I will have to get used to it. Also, my speed with touch typing all the different characters and formats will obviously get faster. I'm happy overall with my understanding of what is going on, and am looking forward to expanding on it.
